Game of Life using pygame
Certainly, here's the updated description with the additional key feature:

This program is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic example of a cellular automaton. This program was created as a student project, and is designed to be both informative and engaging. The program allows users to create an initial configuration of cells, which then evolve according to simple rules, creating complex patterns over time.

The rules of the game are straightforward:
*Each cell in the simulation can be either alive or dead.
*The state of each cell depends on its eight nearest neighbors.
*If a live cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies of loneliness.
*If a live cell has more than three neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.
*If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive.

This program includes several key features to enhance the user experience, including:
*Customizable starting configurations: Users can create their own starting configurations or choose from a variety of pre-set examples.
*Multiple simulation speeds: Users can control the speed at which the simulation runs, allowing for detailed analysis of the evolving patterns.
*Graphical User Interface (GUI): The program includes a user-friendly interface with visualization tools, making it easy to navigate and observe the evolving patterns.
*Endless field: The field of cells extends infinitely in all directions, allowing for endless exploration of different patterns.
